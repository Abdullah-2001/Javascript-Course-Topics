// const name = "abdullah"; this is called we declared it and assigned it a value
// name = "hamza"; this is called we assigned it a value but it gives us an error message const value remains constant we can't change it

// VAR => we can re-declare with the same name and re-assign new value
// LET => we can't re-declare with the same name but re-assign new value
// CONST => we can't re-declare with the same name and can't re-assign new value because const value remains constant
